Data Exploration Notes

Initial data scan highlights:
Four key columns contain required analytics data, meeting project needs without additional client input.
Initial column shows channel IDs with "@" separators requiring channel name extraction.
Foreign language headers and cells necessitate review for relevance and translation.
Excess data suggests column removal for refinement.
Data Cleaning

Target data appearance and constraints:
Data refinement ensures the dataset is structured for analysis:

Columns limited to essentials.
Suitable data types for each column.
Null values excluded for comprehensive record data.
(Cleaned dataset constraints and schema in tables)

Steps for Data Cleaning and Formatting

Trim extraneous columns to essential selections.
Extract channel names from initial column IDs.
Renamed columns using designated identifiers.
